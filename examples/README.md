This folder is intended for folks to post example Qualtrics surveys or JavaScript/HTML/CSS code that others can look through.

`.qsf` stands for Qualtrics Survey File. Now an example here is not necessarily a "perfect" survey; I've included both good and bad questions here, because it's useful for you to see a variety of questions and questionnaires in order to see what you might want to do differently.

`.js` stands for JavaScript file. `.html` standards for an HTML file. `.css` stands for a custom styling sheet. Of note, some folks may create a new folder to group together all the files that are used for a single experiment.
