			<p>Welcome!</p>
			
			<hr>

			<p>This module will focus on basic survey design as this pertains to <i>online</i> programming. A number of issues arise when it comes to the layout of a survey, hosting a survey, choosing the type of question that would best address your question, and more. For example, because we are discussing surveys on the Web, some things you might want to consider are how web surveys are self-administered, computerized, interactive, distributed, and rich, visual tools. In Module 1, we discussed, for instance, how you ought to run your instructions by other nonexperts to ensure that they can be understood by most: this is merely one consequence of self-administering web surveys and often their anonymous distribution as well.</p>

			<p>	There are many differences between how someone experiences a survey in person vs. online. Online, participants use different browsers (Chrome vs. Firefox vs. Internet Explorer, etc.), have different versions of browsers (Chrome version 87 vs. version 86), have different operating systems (Windows 10 versus Mac OS), have different screen resolutions (1024 x 768 vs. 800 x 600), have differently sized browser windows (i.e., not full-screen), have different connection types and speeds, and have different settings (background color, font size, the way each browser renders a particular font, security settings, etc.). This is not to mention issues that arise from particular scripts: that is, certain code works better for different browsers, and some browsers have default security settings that make scripts designed for interacting with the browsers not as useful. People also use different devices to interact with the internet: their keyboard, mouse, or touching via their mobile phone, etc. Some of these issues would take a different form if administering the survey in person, but for us, this means we have to particularly be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience" class="copy-link">User Experience (UX)</a>. We have to try to understand how our participants interact with the survey in order to properly assess our constructs and questions of interest. For example, take a look at the display below:</p>

			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Show me worse UX than this: <a href="https://t.co/btJEbS72Kf">pic.twitter.com/btJEbS72Kf</a></p>&mdash; I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/1337538974789865473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

			<p>The point here is that this is confusing to you as a user: what does each option do? Does declining result in ending your current call? Or are you declining the call that's coming in? Why does the same icon refer to completely different actions? If you click on that thread, you'll find numerous other examples of this: for example, the <a href="https://twitter.com/EdCharbeneau/status/1337539619693486083" class="copy-link">fire TV remote</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/jamestharpe/status/1337540116957556739" class="copy-link">Apple mouse charger</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/farkweezbo/status/1337540151975800841" class="copy-link">error prompts</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/luiscerezo/status/1337549549229895680" class="copy-link">user icons</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/helmsb/status/1337564279348862976" class="copy-link">more phone call icons</a>, etc. Why does this matter? Well, if you're a social scientist studying people, you need to make sure that <i>people</i> can actually understand what you're asking them. That means good survey design.</p>

			<p>Of note, while we will discuss good design principles, you will have to balance this against your need to a) actually measure the construct or question you're interested in and b) the user experience. Design should be both aesthetically pleasing <b>and</b> functional. For example, see what the psychologists below point out about Google's newly redesigned icons:</p>

			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When Google changes feature search to conjunction search... <a href="https://t.co/GZKL6eGRwH">pic.twitter.com/GZKL6eGRwH</a></p>&mdash; Icelandic Vision Lab (@IceVisLab) <a href="https://twitter.com/IceVisLab/status/1325924229389422599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

			<p>Sure, these Google icons involve all the Google brand colors, which could arguably help the company reinforce the brand's design principles, but what made the icons really "easy" to spot in the past was that each had both a unique shape and color pattern. They stood out. You could immediately tell the difference between the calendar and gmail icon. With the colors all together like this, that makes spotting the difference a lot harder. It makes understanding how the function of each differs a little harder.</p>
			
			<p>In this module, we will thus be discussing how to design, host, and distribute surveys that will hopefully be more intuitive for your users (participants). We here assume that you've already got your well-worded questions and well-crafted response options: that is a part of research methods and beyond the scope of this course. Here, we'll view survey design through the lens of user experience.</p>

			<p>If you are looking for additional resources on research methods, you could read <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/communication/faculty/krosnick/docs/2009/2009_handbook_krosnick.pdf" class="copy-link">this chapter</a>, which addresses questions about e.g., how many points should go on a scale question, how many labels should be used for scale questions, etc. A lot of the survey design lessons were also based on the textbook, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/designing-effective-web-surveys/C709B3E307CF5F462F8267078C3A0E02" class="copy-link">Couper (2008)</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="subsec21" class="pad1">Principles of Online Programming</h2>

			<p>Given the fact that the online experience is so different from the in person experience, there are some basic principles that researchers should follow if they want their research to replicate. For one, researchers must ensure that their work is publically available - in the state that it was run - so that other researchers can experience the survey or experiment for themselves. Researchers must also consider what their participants experience when they're doing their survey/experiment, and an online survey/experiment also requires a stable way to host the survey or experiment so that participants can actually answer your questions. We will consider these in more detail below.</p>
						
			<h4 id="subsec21t1" class="pad1">The importance of version control</h4>
			
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" class="copy-link">Version control</a> refers to a management system for handling different forms of information. Any time a particular document is modified, revised, or changed, it is marked: whether by creating a new file or merging the same file. For example, academics will often use version control with respect to a manuscript. You might name a document projectname_resultsmethods_v1.docx, indicating the first version of your Results and Methods draft for said project, and then when someone revises or comments on the manuscript, they'll append their initials so the new saved document says _v1_CB and so on. As a Duke student, you may have been encouraged to use Box. When you do, if you upload the same file to the same path/area, Box will save the file under its current name but indicate that the file is now v2, showing that it had already been uploaded previously (and allowing you to access the original version of that old file).</p>
			
			<p>With respect to code and surveys, developers will particularly use version control to help maintain documentation and control over source code. That is, each time the code changes substantially, they will want to upload or make a "commit" or revision to the code on an online repository (such as Github) so that they essentially have notes as to what has changed.</p>
			
			<p>What exactly version control looks like will depend on what platform is being used for your survey or experiment. For example, if you're using a survey platform such as Qualtrics instead of hard-coding your questionnaire, version control might look like copying your survey whenever you make major changes and renaming the new project, indicating to yourself what revisions were made. You might even post the survey file or a PDF of the survey file to an open repository - either one private just for yourself or public for other researchers to see - so that you can refer back to what your methods looked like as you continued developing the project or when your participants actually saw the survey. This is particularly helpful given that survey platforms will often autosave your survey if you make a single change, and you may not necessarily want every change you've made to be realized in the final version. I really cannot emphasize this more, even if version control is not typically talked of with respect to surveys on standard survey platforms. I've had a few surveys with other collaborators, and any time multiple people are working on any project could lead to a number of issues. Combined with the defauls that are in some of these survey platforms, this made for ripe scenarios where we've had typos, unsaved edits (e.g., both of us working on the survey at the same time and then the platform not saving the edit), and edits that were saved but that impacted other parts of the survey and which we thought were okay. If we had been more vigilant with our version control, we may have been able to catch such errors. If you hardcoded your questionnaire, you would definitely want to post your code to a repository, as it would help save (store) your (currently functioning) code in case you change lines and the codes stops working (i.e., version control in this case helps you make proper revisions).</p>

			<p>To give an example, you can find the version control for this Github repository here (specifically <a href="https://github.com/socsciprogramming/socsciprogramming.github.io/commits/master/module2.html" class="copy-link">Module 2</a>). Notably, none of these edits are all that good in terms of version control: I should've written what actually changed as a note each time that I uploaded a new version of the website file. Even still, you can see what Github indicates is new for the file when you click on a particular update. You can see when I added new content or when I changed the layout. Because this is Module 2, by that time, I was primarily focused on changing the content, but if you looked up Module 1 or the Index page, the version control would look very different.</p>
			
			<p>Because you'll be coding your survey or experiment for an online population, it is especially important to use version control not just for your own sake, but also for your colleagues who may want to replicate your work or use a scale measure or see how exactly you assessed a particular construct. Whether you're coding the survey or experiment yourself or using a survey platform or other aide, you should *always* include some version control system in your research plans.</p>
			
			<h4 id="subsec21t2" class="pad1">Design or code with user experience in mind</h4>
			
			<p>As discussed above, one of the most important things is to ascertain whether your participants actually understand what you are asking. You need to prioritize the user experience in your survey design and your code as well.</p>
			
			<p>That will look different depending on your particular plans. What measurements do you need in your experiment or survey? How can you reduce the burden of retrieving the output, and how can you ensure your output is an accurate reflection of what your participant meant while doing your study? How can you make things as easy as possible for the participants who are doing your task?</p>
			
			<p>I will give one brief example of the ways in which user experience can define the constructs we're studying. In developmental psychology, many of the same tasks that are used with older populations are gamified so that children will be able to do the task in question. If they were not gamified, the tasks would be too boring, and the children participants would presumably stop paying attention, which would suggest that the construct being studied may not be what you think it is. Outside of developmental psychology, you can see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4981081/" class="copy-link">another study</a> that explicitly takes a UX approach to how its psychological intervention is designed. The authors recognized that iteratively improving a particular lesson (or in this case, intervention) by evaluating participant responses with respect to the lesson goals was important for maximal impact. Moreover, they could make sure that these responses actually reflected what they thought participant responses would look like.</p>
			
			<p>Here, I'm not necessarily suggesting that you have to completely change your task - oh, go gamify everything! However, as stated in Module 1, it's important to have people test out your survey or experiment before you run your study in earnest. It's important that not just be people in your lab, because things that seem normal to you (or other people who know your work) may not seem that way to your participants (unless you want only expert responses). You can check how comprehensible your survey or experiment are by running a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/" class="copy-link">usability test</a> or observe participants doing your study in their natural habitat (like with their own computer; see <a href="https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/how-to/observation/use-ethnographic-methods-participant-observation" class="copy-link">ethnographic observations</a>). Whatever your wording or question or design, it will not be perfect on the first try, and continually checking in with your potential population will help you make sure that you are studying what you think you are.</p>
			
			<p>On my own end, I have a paper that I published where I claim that people weren't aware of a manipulation we included to make one part of the study harder than the other. Recently, with another project within the same domain, I ran a usability test with similar question wording, and one problem that arose was that participants didn't entirely understand what the question was asking. In other words, what I had previously assumed meant was a lack of awareness might in fact reflect noise in my measurement tools. If you use an iterative research process, you will be able to improve your survey design until you get something closer to what you hope to measure.</p>
			
			<h4 id="subsec21t3" class="pad1">Hosting your experiment online</h4>
			
			<p>The last and final principle of onling programming that I want to discuss in this subsection relates to the online nature. If an online survey or experiment, then you're responsible for ensuring that everyone can actually access the study. In fact, this actually connects back to our Diversity & Inclusion considertaion from Module 1: although we've been going over principles of online programming, inherently by having an online study, we are excluding parts of the population: likely for social scientists, not everyone in the target population will have access to the Internet, and not everyone who has Internet access may have the same knowledge of how to use the Internet (my dad barely knows how to use email, for example). As you can imagine, this can result in serious UX issues and generalization issues as well as serious hosting issues.</p>
			
			<p>Let me give an example of a study I was consulting on and how hosting can become an issue. We were trying to evaluate how good a particular product was, and the survey I had was hosted in a famous survey platform, with a link to the product so participants could experience the product and then return to the survey to answer questions about it. This study was run with an online panel. Now, you might already anticipate what the user experience issue is here: people do not like going to another site while they're in a survey. They don't like signing up for things - even if you give them all the login information they need - and they don't want to remember other things like passwords when they were set to just answer questions. We were also assuming something specific about our population: that they would understand how to return to the survey and were broadly Internet literate (which actually wasn't the biggest issue). We hit a snag: we needed people to actually use the product being evaluated (instead of stopping/dropping out the survey), we needed a large number of people to do the survey (we couldn't just invite all these people to look at the product in person), and we needed to probe their understanding of how the product worked and whether the product essentially did its job. So, in addition to the user experience issue, there was also a hosting issue: that is, the survey host was distinct from where the product was being hosted, and this caused drop-out from survey participants. All of these online programming principles can indeed interact like this to create additional considerations for you as a researcher.</p>
			
			<p>In this particular course and module, one way that we will solve survey design issues is to use a survey platform called Qualtrics. (If your institution does not have Qualtrics, consider <a href="https://mopinion.com/alternatives-and-competitors-of-qualtrics/" class="copy-link">alternatives</a>; for Duke students, this is at duke.qualtrics.com). You can get somewhat around the issue of hosting if you're using a survey platform (though, see above example), since the survey platform will take care of that for you. (Similarly, our next subsection will go over survey design considerations, which the creators of or upkeep team for these survey platforms usually have considered).</p>
			
			<p>If you don't want to use a survey platform but want to hardcode your survey or experiment, you can, but you will now definitely have to consider where to host the survey. If you want a free option, you can host your survey on Github, much in the same way that this site is hosted here on Github via Github pages. <a href="https://pages.github.com/" class="copy-link">Github pages</a> has a tutorial on how to set up your website so that you can host a survey. To give an example, let's look at our <a href="https://github.com/socsciprogramming/socsciprogramming.github.io" class="copy-link">site's repository!</a> Because our site is already publically hosted via the Github pages interface, we could now upload a file in this repository and send anyone in the world the link to socsciprogramming.github.io/FILENAME. Now, if you're hardcoding, you'd want your file to be dynamic and record data, but we'll go over that part in Module 3. The point here is that this site takes advantage of Microsoft's resources via Github Pages so that I could send this link to any participant (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_GitHub#:~:text=GitHub%20has%20been%20the%20target,China%2C%20India%2C%20Russia%2C%20and" class="copy-link">potentially excluding some countries</a>) and not worry about whether there would be an access problem.</p> 
			
			<p>Finally, if you're a Duke student, you can actually use what's known as your personal <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/cifs" class="copy-link">CIFS (Common Internet File System) home directory</a>. Duke has created a tutorial for accessing this from <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0013655" class="copy-link">Windows</a> and <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0013637" class="copy-link">Mac</a>. If you're trying to access this directory outside of Duke (i.e., not connected to the Duke network), you'll need to login via the Duke VPN (Virtual Private Network - see links for details). If you're not a Duke student but are a student elsewhere, it is likely that your university has a version of this. Here's what <a href="files/cifspreview.png" class="copy-link">it looks like</a> when you are connected:</p>
			
			<img src="files/cifspreview.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-none d-xl-block pad-t75 pad-b75" alt="cifspreview"></img>
			
			<p>And then you can access whatever files you're hosting in that public_html folder by going to https://people.duke.edu/~YOURNETID/FILENAME. If you've put your file in a folder within the public_html folder, you'd put FOLDERNAME/FILENAME after the net id portion. For example, you can see <a href="http://people.duke.edu/~cb383/" class="copy-link">my CIFS site</a> here. Mine is blank because of the file that I have in the public_html folder. You can see <a href="http://people.duke.edu/~vs164/myCode/" class="copy-link">my RA's site here</a>, including the experiment he coded for Duke undergraduates. Which should you use? Well, I like using Duke's CIFS for tasks because I trust Duke OIT to keep the server going for its researchers, whereas I know a lot less about Microsoft's priorities and scheduled Github repairs, etc. But it's your personal choice!</p>
			
			<p>If you want to see more Github Pages repositories, you can check out: <a href="https://github.com/jmxpearson/jmxpearson.github.io" class="copy-link">John Pearson's lab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pswhitehead/pswhitehead" class="copy-link">Peter Whitehead's personal Github</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevingoneill/kevingoneill.github.io" class="copy-link">Kevin O'Neill's personal Github</a>, etc. Probably the most helpful is looking at <a href="https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory" class="copy-link">expfactory</a>, which is a repository full of other hardcoded tasks (and we will return to this later).</p>
