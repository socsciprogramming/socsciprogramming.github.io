						<p>Why learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS? Well, if you need to manipulate variables at a deeper level than can be done in a survey platform, you may want to do this yourself. You may want to learn how to code your own website. You may need to scrape a website or deal with a large amount of information from social media sites (e.g., studies that look at what people are tweeting). You may want to collect reaction time data in a more consistent manner than some other survey platforms do. Whatever the reason, you've now ended up here on the Module aimed at teaching basic skills for these languages that are the basis of world wide web pages.</p>
						
						<p>Of note, there are a LOT of additional resources for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every time I look at Google on my phone, it knows that I've been writing about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and suggests some article to that effect - there are entire communities that focus on creating packages and functionality within these languages. Here are some resources for you to peruse:
						
						<ul class="fa-ul">
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>Chapter 9 of <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/web-experiments.html" class="copy-link">Matthew Crump's "Programming for Psychologists"</a> goes over programming for Web Experiments and Chapter 8 goes over another site that helps generate source code for you to run online experiments.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>Code Academy has an <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" class="copy-link">Introduction to JavaScript</a>.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>May I recommend yet another <a href="https://javascript.info/" class="copy-link">JavaScript tutorial</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw" class="copy-link">set of videos oriented to giving you a project using JavasScript</a>? Similarly, there is an entire set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr6-GrHUlVf8JIgLcu3sHigvQjTw_aC9C" class="copy-link">video tutorials for beginners on CSS</a>, and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-kBRUXsuSQ?start=1&end=147" class="copy-link">intro to HTML and CSS video</a> for beginners in thinking about websites generally.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>W3Schools is your friend. Every time I forget a particular element for code, I search on Google for what I need, and the most frequent site that pops up with the answer is undoubtedly W3Schools. They have a tutorial on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" class="copy-link">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" class="copy-link">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" class="copy-link">JavaScript</a>. The MDN Web Docs are also your friend: Mozilla has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials" class="copy-link">open-source resources on these languages</a> for web developers at all stages of expertise. Similarly, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" class="copy-link">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="https://stackexchange.com/" class="copy-link">StackExchange</a> are your friends when you're coding. Someone else has likely had the same issue you've had and posted their error to StackOverflow, where other kind folks will respond with crowdsourced solutions. Make sure to be specific in your Google Search for what you're looking for, and then you'll likely find a solution (unless you're doing something highly, highly specialized, like creating your own package or library).</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>Raphael Geddert in the Egner Lab also compiled a list of resources on <a href="https://github.com/egnerlab/Lab-Manual/blob/master/Programming/JavaScript-HTML-CSS/README.md" class="copy-link">JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</a>; some are already listed here.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>If you're a Duke student, you can also access the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web" class="copy-link">"Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS" coursera</a> and the co-lab <a href="https://colab.duke.edu/roots/track?id=3" class="copy-link">roots courses on the Web Development track</a>, which include courses on HTML and CSS, with an aim towards creating your own website.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>This course differs from those resources in that we're taking an applied perspective. If you want to know the fundamentals from a computer science perspective, you may be better off looking through the coursera or going through the other tutorials that have a more of a strict programming lens. My perspective is that of an applied scientist: I understand what is going on with the code, and I am teaching you the basics and how people use the basics to create experiments. I will not comment on whether certain scripts have the "right" structure or formatting. In other words, I don't care if you get the right answer within 100 lines of code or 10: I care that you know what your code is doing and have checked and tested the code properly, but anything else will be beyond the scope of this course. Using 100 lines of code will of course take longer to load than 10, but with the tools you'll learn in bugging and testing, you can see whether your code formatting will pose an issue for the User Experience.</p>
						
						<p>Of course, one other question that you might have is whether you even need to code your experiment in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For example, if you have already coded your experiment in PsychoPy (a Python-based framework), you should check out <a href="https://pavlovia.org" class="copy-link">Pavlovia</a>, a tool to help convert your already existing code. Similarly, you may find that some of the experiments (within psychology) that you're looking for are already coded, via the <a href="https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments" class="copy-link">Expfactory Github</a>. But, if you're not among that group...</p>

						<p>For the purpose of this module and writing code using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, you will need a good text editor. Some options include: <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" class="copy-link">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/" class="copy-link">Atom</a>, <a href="http://brackets.io/" class="copy-link">Brackets</a>, and <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html" class="copy-link">Textwrangler</a>. (Undoubtedly, there are more, like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" class="copy-link">Sublime</a>, but here is a small selection). I personally use Notepad++ because it has a very simple interface, and I like that when I'm coding. Atom has additional packages that can color each language (show when you're using HTML vs. JavaScript vs. CSS), auto-indent and oraganize your code, and link directly to Github, and to my knowledge, Textwrangler also does this. Brackets has that functionality, but also employs the ability to live test your HTML out, because it creates a local copy that can get published for a 'preview.' Moreover, Brackets employs a JavaScript library (that we'll go over in <a href="module4.html" class="copy-link">Module 4</a>) that checks your code for what it thinks are errors. Outside of Brackets, you can also preview what your code looks like using places like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" class="copy-link">JSFiddle</a>, <a href="https://glitch.com/" class="copy-link">Glitch</a>, <a href="https://jsbin.com/?html,output" class="copy-link">JSBin</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/" class="copy-link">CodePen</a>. So, the simplest option is Notepad++, then Atom or Textwrangler, and then Brackets. (If you really want the local testing of Bracekts but to use another text editor, you can set up your own <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server" class="copy-link">local testing server</a>). Once you've gotten your text editor program downloaded, and presuming you've already got version control in place after <a href="module2.html" class="copy-link" target="_self">Module 2</a>, then join me on the journey to get into the basics of these languages!</p>

					<div>
						<p>When you load a webpage, your browser looks at the code and renders web content according to its internal guidelines. If you want to see what I mean by the latter, you can load this exact webpage in both Chrome and Firefox. It looks a little different, right? It's the same code, but the way each browser interacts with the code differs.</p>
						
						<img src="files/firefox_chrome_example.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block pad-t75 pad-b75" alt="Comparing Firefox and Chrome Browser Rendering"></img>
						
						<p>In the <a href="files/firefox_chrome_example.png" class="copy-link">example above</a>, Firefox is on the left and Chrome is on the right, loading the initial view of this webpage on the same exact screen at the same browser size, and yet you can notice a slight difference between the two. But isn't that also the genius of the code? No matter what browser this code is read on, it looks almost exactly the same. So, let's define what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript even are.</p>
						
						<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. As a Markup language, HTML will process certain "tags" (elements) that will communicate with the browser. All browsers can recognize HTML and have been designed to do so: HTML is the foundation and structure of the content that you will see on websites. As the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" class="copy-link">Mozilla Developer Guide</a> says, HTML can "give [pieces of text] different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page." If you were to look at <a href="https://github.com/socsciprogramming/socsciprogramming.github.io/blob/master/module3.html" class="copy-link">the code for Module 3</a> - which we will do in more detail below - you would see a whole lot of HTML with our website content and a standard structure. HTML files naturally have the extension ".html". </p>
						
						<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a styling language, used primarily to impose display rules and properties on the HTML content of websites, changing their layout and look (e.g., font, color and size of any element, spacing, animations, columns for content, etc.). In the sections below, we will also look at the <a href="https://github.com/socsciprogramming/socsciprogramming.github.io/blob/master/css/allpages.css" class="copy-link">custom CSS sheet</a> used for this module. CSS files naturally have the extension ".css". While learning HTML and CSS, people will often move back and forth between the two languages because they work well together, and you can get by on a webpage without using JavaScript, but typically use HTML and CSS together for any webpage.</p>
						
						<p>Finally, JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used to interact with the HTML (and CSS) - it runs on its own, runs computations, controls the behavior of the website, etc. At the bottom of this tutorial site, there is an up arrow colored in purple. When you click the up arrow, it will scroll you all the way back to the top of the site via JavaScript. It also uses an interactive element called a "tooltip" that will appear when you hover on the arrow, the hover being a "trigger event" that is dictated by JavaScript. JavaScript helps a webpage do more than display static information. JavaScript files have the extension ".js".</p>
									
						<p>So, now let's more fully explore how HTML provides the structure and content that is styled by CSS and that interacts with JavaScript.</p>
					</div>
				<section>
					<ul class="fa-ul"><li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></span><h4 id="subsec31t1">Providing structure and content with HTML</h4></li></ul>
					<div>
						<!--
						I'm not sure how long these modules are, but I typically like starting with HTML/CSS building static websites. Maybe even a little assignment where they build a single-page personal website. Then moving on to JS, which you can teach as the tool for manipulating the HTML/CSS you see on the screen.
						-->
						
						<p>As a markup language, HTML is made of elements that are composed of opening and closing tags marked by these carrot keypresses: < and >.  In both the opening and closing tag, you'll wrap the name of the element (p for paragraph text, b for bold text, etc.) in these opening and closing carrot keypresses (or angle brackets), marking both where the element starts and ends. In short, an HTML element is the opening tag (<code><p></code>) + content (paragraph (p) text here!) + closing tag <code></p></code>. Note that the closing tag is almost exactly like the opening tag, but includes a forward slash to indicte the end of the tag (and element).</p>

						<p>If you only have an opening tag or only have a closing tag, your stuff may go haywire. For example, I sometimes forget to include a closing tag when I'm linking off site, and because of the styling rules on this site, all the text then turns purple or blue to indicate a link. That is, I broke the syntax of HTML by not including a closing tag, and the HTML tag will assume that the rest of the content is a part of the element until it reaches the next closing tag. Here's what this paragraph looks like in the code!</p>

						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">

You're probably most familiar with nested elements with respect to <b>bolding</b>, <i>italicizing</i>, <em>emphasizing</em>, <u>underlining</u>, or <s>striking through</s> text.</p>

						<p>Every HTML is 
						
						Every element in HTML is contained inside a box.

Boxes can be nested inside of other boxes creating a parent-child relationship
between the boxes.

Space can be created within the box (padding) and outside the box (margin).

						<p> </p>
						
						DISPLAYS

HTML elements are also given default displays which dictate their behavior in
relation to other elements.

Display Block forces the element’s box to take on 100% of the width of the
available space.

Most Display Inline elements ignore all width and height styling and display
inline with their other Inline surroundings.

The block versus inline elements of HTML discussion & how that's changed

Element (example: images, line breaks).

<p>Predefined attributes </p>

HTML elements come with predefined qualities or attributes which help
differentiate them when no styling has been applied yet.

Font size, text decorations, and margins are given default values for most
elements.

show also the example of accidentally not including quotes around my attributes... and single and double quotes both work, but have to be paired within class (single with single, double with double. It's like English grammar, too: if you're already showing dialogue with someone speaking and you want to show a string in between, you'd need to use a single quote nested in the double quote (or a double quote nested within the single)).).

Let’s look more closely at the code block above. All html documents begin with <html> and end with </html>. This is a general rule for all html statements (although there are some exceptions), they all start with < >, and end with </ >. For example,

Important: HTML elements can each be assigned a unique id. This allows the element to act as a variable that can be controlled by Javascript. Notice the second paragraph states:

This paragraph has the id, p1. We will be able to use Javascript to refer to this pargraph and control it’s behavior (hide and show, change contents etc.).

How do you comment out text in html?

(below metadata, styling, etc.) -->

						<p>Now let's look at the basics of one of these subsections:</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;ul class="fa-ul"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;span class="fa-li"&gt; &lt;i class="fas fa-star"&gt; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;h4 id="subsec31t1"&gt; Providing structure and content with HTML &lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>This is the code that creates the subsection/tutorial header "Providing structure and content with HTML". <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" class="copy-link">UL</a> stands for "unordered list" and is a type of HTML element used to create bullet-point lists. The class "fa-ul" is special, referring to the CSS package I load in from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery" class="copy-link">Font Awesome</a>, which has an entire library of free icons that people can use on their webpages. We will get to "classes" more <a href="#subsec31t2" class="copy-link">in the next subsection on CSS</a>, but this class is "fa-ul", indicating it's the Font Awesome Unordered List (class). <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li" class="copy-link">LI</a> stands for "list item" and is often a bullet point within the "UL". Notably, you can also have "ordered lists" or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol" class="copy-link">OL</a> (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu" class="copy-link">menus</a>, which are also composed of LI elements. Next up in the header code is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" class="copy-link">"span"</a>, which doesn't necessarily stand for anything, but is often used to group together elements for styling in a particular line. (In this case, we're saying that the span element is of the "fa-li" class, or Font Awesome List Item (class); one thing to note here is that it's important to be able to read and mark other code, and the Font Awesome folks have made that possible: anything that is fa- or fas/fab is likely a Font Awesome styled element). So, after specifying the styling for the list element via the span element and its class, we use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i" class="copy-link">"i" element</a>, or idiomatic text element, which here is of the Font Awesome Solid and Font Awesome Star (classes), i.e., the star icon that you see next to the header. Essentially, I wanted to use a marker besides the indent that I have set (in CSS) for the header classes and thus created star bullet points to indicate each new subsection. After styling, we see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements" class="copy-link">"h4" element</a>, which stands for the 4th header element. There are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 header elements, and they differ in designation, with 1 being the highest section level and 6 the lowest (often shown in differing sizes). On this site, I use the h1 element for the Module Title, the h2 element for each Section Title (e.g., <a href="#subsec31" class="copy-link">Basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</a>), and the h4 element for any subsection/tutorial. It is particularly important to follow a sort of hierarchical designation as a means of ensuring accessibility: screen readers rely on sites being designated in a hierarchical fashion, with headers indicated by these h elements, sections indicated by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" class="copy-link">section elements</a>, navigation links indicated by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" class="copy-link">nav elements</a>, and paragraph elements like this text being indicated by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" class="copy-link">p elements</a>. We put the header as part of the LI element and UL list to make sure that they're aligned at the same level (otherwise the code will not group together the elements). I also gave the header the id of subsec31t1, representing module 3, section 1, tutorial 1 and that it is a subsection. Each section or subsection has its own id so that if I wanted to link you there, I could easily do that, since ids should be unique to elements you'll navigate to.</p>
						
						<p>And voila! That is one line of code within this particular site. In your experiments, you may not really need to use bullet points (LI, UL, OL) - that probably depends on how you like to give instructions - but you should abide by standard guidelines for header and page elements, at the very least. We can take a look at the basic organization of this site as an example:</p>
						
						<p>I create a new section for every one of these tutorials, because I do tend to think of them as subsections within a larger section, which is... </p>

CSS also follows a specificity model in which the most unique selector takes
precedence over the less unique selectors (ID > Classes > Tags).

The syntax

CSS is made of rules.

Rules are made of selectors and declarations.

Declarations are made of one or more properties and their matching values
placed inside curly brackets.

All properties must be closed by a semi-colon.

						<p>In most experiments, I don't use as much CSS as I do with styling webpages like this or my own personal website. I try to use CSS as a framework that guides User Experience, like making buttons a certain color and shape to be consistent across the entire experiment. I specify Arial as the font for basically everything, since it's a pretty standard (i.e., on most computers) and easy to read font.</p>

			making the user experience a little better with javascript tweaks. for example, you can customize the words on the 'next' button on individual pages to say stuff like "proceed to experiment" or "view consent" to cue people. or if you have a text box, you can put dummy text in it that disappears when you click on it that provides an example of the type of response you're thinking of - I would describe this as thinking with an `ux copy` mind for experiments

						<p>If you want to "explore" on your own, let me suggest opening the JavaScript Developer Console on this site. Then edit whatever HTML you'd like and see what happens - live - to the site itself. What does each CSS styling correspond to? What does each element correspond to? What happens if you add more JavaScript to the site? One of the best ways to learn how to code is to take something that already exists and mess with it until you see what your changes do. Then you'll have a framework to work with when you are coding on your own.</p>
						
						<p>Find one of your favorite websites and open the Developer console. For example, why not take a look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" class="copy-link">Mozilla Developer site for HTML</a>? It's beautifully styled, with a clear hierarchy of information and tables to define particular elements. You can learn more about all the possible HTML elements while looking at how they've coded the structure of the site and how their CSS has styled the site with an almost magazine-like modern, clean look. Poke around and see how they've defined everything.</p>
						
						<p>Create a sample pre-screen HIT on MTurk, applying what you learned from Module 1, that is coded in the HTML/source interface with CSS styling, applying what you learned from Module 3, and that uses basic survey design principles, applying what you learned from Module 2, to assess participant demographics.</p>
