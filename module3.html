						<p>Why learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS? Well, if you need to manipulate variables at a deeper level than can be done in a survey platform, you may want to do this yourself. You may want to learn how to code your own website. You may need to scrape a website or deal with a large amount of information from social media sites (e.g., studies that look at what people are tweeting). You may want to collect reaction time data in a more consistent manner than some other survey platforms do. Whatever the reason, you've now ended up here on the Module aimed at teaching basic skills for these languages that are the basis of world wide web pages.</p>
						
						<p>Of note, there are a LOT of additional resources for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every time I look at Google on my phone, it knows that I've been writing about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and suggests some article to that effect - there are entire communities that focus on creating packages and functionality within these languages. Here are some resources for you to peruse:
						
						<ul class="fa-ul">
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>Chapter 9 of <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/web-experiments.html" class="copy-link">Matthew Crump's "Programming for Psychologists"</a> goes over programming for Web Experiments and Chapter 8 goes over another site that helps generate source code for you to run online experiments.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>Code Academy has an <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" class="copy-link">Introduction to JavaScript</a>.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>May I recommend yet another <a href="https://javascript.info/" class="copy-link">JavaScript tutorial</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw" class="copy-link">set of videos oriented to giving you a project using JavasScript</a>? Similarly, there is an entire set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr6-GrHUlVf8JIgLcu3sHigvQjTw_aC9C" class="copy-link">video tutorials for beginners on CSS</a>, and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-kBRUXsuSQ?start=1&end=147" class="copy-link">intro to HTML and CSS video</a> for beginners in thinking about websites generally.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>W3Schools is your friend. Every time I forget a particular element for code, I search on Google for what I need, and the most frequent site that pops up with the answer is undoubtedly W3Schools. They have a tutorial on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" class="copy-link">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" class="copy-link">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" class="copy-link">JavaScript</a>. The MDN Web Docs are also your friend: Mozilla has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials" class="copy-link">open-source resources on these languages</a> for web developers at all stages of expertise. Similarly, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" class="copy-link">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="https://stackexchange.com/" class="copy-link">StackExchange</a> are your friends when you're coding. Someone else has likely had the same issue you've had and posted their error to StackOverflow, where other kind folks will respond with crowdsourced solutions. Make sure to be specific in your Google Search for what you're looking for, and then you'll likely find a solution (unless you're doing something highly, highly specialized, like creating your own package or library).</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>Raphael Geddert in the Egner Lab also compiled a list of resources on <a href="https://github.com/egnerlab/Lab-Manual/blob/master/Programming/JavaScript-HTML-CSS/README.md" class="copy-link">JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</a>; some are already listed here.</li>
							<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-arrow-right"></i>If you're a Duke student, you can also access the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web" class="copy-link">"Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS" coursera</a> and the co-lab <a href="https://colab.duke.edu/roots/track?id=3" class="copy-link">roots courses on the Web Development track</a>, which include courses on HTML and CSS, with an aim towards creating your own website.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>This course differs from those resources in that we're taking an applied perspective. If you want to know the fundamentals from a computer science perspective, you may be better off looking through the coursera or going through the other tutorials that have a more of a strict programming lens. My perspective is that of an applied scientist: I understand what is going on with the code, and I am teaching you the basics and how people use the basics to create experiments. I will not comment on whether certain scripts have the "right" structure or formatting. In other words, I don't care if you get the right answer within 100 lines of code or 10: I care that you know what your code is doing and have checked and tested the code properly, but anything else will be beyond the scope of this course. Using 100 lines of code will of course take longer to load than 10, but with the tools you'll learn in bugging and testing, you can see whether your code formatting will pose an issue for the User Experience.</p>
						
						<p>Of course, one other question that you might have is whether you even need to code your experiment in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For example, if you have already coded your experiment in PsychoPy (a Python-based framework), you should check out <a href="https://pavlovia.org" class="copy-link">Pavlovia</a>, a tool to help convert your already existing code. Similarly, you may find that some of the experiments (within psychology) that you're looking for are already coded, via the <a href="https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments" class="copy-link">Expfactory Github</a>. But, if you're not among that group...</p>

						<p>For the purpose of this module and writing code using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, you will need a good text editor. Some options include: <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" class="copy-link">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/" class="copy-link">Atom</a>, <a href="http://brackets.io/" class="copy-link">Brackets</a>, and <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html" class="copy-link">Textwrangler</a>. (Undoubtedly, there are more, like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" class="copy-link">Sublime</a>, but here is a small selection). I personally use Notepad++ because it has a very simple interface, and I like that when I'm coding. Atom has additional packages that can color each language (show when you're using HTML vs. JavaScript vs. CSS), auto-indent and oraganize your code, and link directly to Github, and to my knowledge, Textwrangler also does this. Brackets has that functionality, but also employs the ability to live test your HTML out, because it creates a local copy that can get published for a 'preview.' Moreover, Brackets employs a JavaScript library (that we'll go over in <a href="module4.html" class="copy-link">Module 4</a>) that checks your code for what it thinks are errors. Outside of Brackets, you can also preview what your code looks like using places like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" class="copy-link">JSFiddle</a>, <a href="https://glitch.com/" class="copy-link">Glitch</a>, <a href="https://jsbin.com/?html,output" class="copy-link">JSBin</a>, and <a href="https://codepen.io/" class="copy-link">CodePen</a>. So, the simplest option is Notepad++, then Atom or Textwrangler, and then Brackets. (If you really want the local testing of Bracekts but to use another text editor, you can set up your own <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server" class="copy-link">local testing server</a>). Once you've gotten your text editor program downloaded, and presuming you've already got version control in place after <a href="module2.html" class="copy-link" target="_self">Module 2</a>, then join me on the journey to get into the basics of these languages!</p>

					<div>
						<p>When you load a webpage, your browser looks at the code and renders web content according to its internal guidelines. If you want to see what I mean by the latter, you can load this exact webpage in both Chrome and Firefox. It looks a little different, right? It's the same code, but the way each browser interacts with the code differs.</p>
						
						<img src="files/firefox_chrome_example.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block pad-t75 pad-b75" alt="Comparing Firefox and Chrome Browser Rendering"></img>
						
						<p>In the <a href="files/firefox_chrome_example.png" class="copy-link">example above</a>, Firefox is on the left and Chrome is on the right, loading the initial view of this webpage on the same exact screen at the same browser size, and yet you can notice a slight difference between the two. But isn't that also the genius of the code? No matter what browser this code is read on, it looks almost exactly the same. So, let's define what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript even are.</p>
						
						<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. As a Markup language, HTML will process certain "tags" (elements) that will communicate with the browser. All browsers can recognize HTML and have been designed to do so: HTML is the foundation and structure of the content that you will see on websites. As the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" class="copy-link">Mozilla Developer Guide</a> says, HTML can "give [pieces of text] different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page." If you were to look at <a href="https://github.com/socsciprogramming/socsciprogramming.github.io/blob/master/module3.html" class="copy-link">the code for Module 3</a> - which we will do in more detail below - you would see a whole lot of HTML with our website content and a standard structure. HTML files naturally have the extension ".html". </p>
						
						<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a styling language, used primarily to impose display rules and properties on the HTML content of websites, changing their layout and look (e.g., font, color and size of any element, spacing, animations, columns for content, etc.). In the sections below, we will also look at the <a href="https://github.com/socsciprogramming/socsciprogramming.github.io/blob/master/css/allpages.css" class="copy-link">custom CSS sheet</a> used for this module. CSS files naturally have the extension ".css". While learning HTML and CSS, people will often move back and forth between the two languages because they work well together, and you can get by on a webpage without using JavaScript, but typically use HTML and CSS together for any webpage.</p>
						
						<p>Finally, JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used to interact with the HTML (and CSS) - it runs on its own, runs computations, controls the behavior of the website, etc. At the bottom of this tutorial site, there is an up arrow colored in purple. When you click the up arrow, it will scroll you all the way back to the top of the site via JavaScript. It also uses an interactive element called a "tooltip" that will appear when you hover on the arrow, the hover being a "trigger event" that is dictated by JavaScript. JavaScript helps a webpage do more than display static information. JavaScript files have the extension ".js".</p>
									
						<p>So, now let's more fully explore how HTML provides the structure and content that is styled by CSS and that interacts with JavaScript.</p>
					</div>
				<section>
					<ul class="fa-ul"><li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></span><h4 id="subsec31t1">Providing structure and content with HTML</h4></li></ul>
					<div>
						<p>As a markup language, HTML is made of elements that are composed of opening and closing tags marked by these carrot keypresses: < and >.  In both the opening and closing tag, you'll wrap the name of the element (p for paragraph text, b for bold text, etc.) in these opening and closing carrot keypresses (or angle brackets), marking both where the element starts and ends. In short, an HTML element is the opening tag (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) + content (paragraph (p) text here!) + closing tag (<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>). Note that the closing tag is almost exactly like the opening tag, but includes a forward slash to indicte the end of the tag (and element).</p>

						<p>If you only have an opening tag or only have a closing tag, your stuff may go haywire. For example, I sometimes forget to include a closing tag when I'm linking off site, and because of the styling rules on this site, all the text then turns purple or blue to indicate a link. That is, I broke the syntax of HTML by not including a closing tag, and the HTML tag will assume that the rest of the content is a part of the element until it reaches the next closing tag. Here's what this paragraph looks like in the code!</p>

						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;p&gt; If you only have an opening tag or only have a closing tag, your stuff may go haywire.

That is, I broke the syntax of HTML by not including a closing tag, and the HTML tag will assume that the rest of the content is a part of the element until it reaches the next closing tag. Here's what this paragraph looks like in the code! &lt;/p&gt;
						</code></pre></div>						
						
						<p>Despite what I said about breaking HTML syntax, note that tags are case-insensitive, meaning that you can spell a tag like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;SPAN&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Span&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;SpAn&gt;</code>, etc. However, most folks use all lower-case for tags: this is what's consistent in other code and it's just more readable - all caps looks like you're shouting, and a mix of upper and lower case is confusing.</p>
						
						<p>You can place elements within other elements, otherwise known as nesting. I can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks" class="copy-link">create a hyperlink</a> to another site with an "a" tag within a paragraph text element. You're probably most familiar with nested elements with respect to <b>bolding</b>, <strong>strongly emphasizing the importance of something</strong>, <i>italicizing</i>, <em>emphasizing</em>, <u>underlining</u>, or <s>striking through</s> text.</p>

						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;p&gt; You can place elements within other elements, otherwise known as nesting.

You're probably most familiar with nested elements with respect to &lt;b&gt;bolding&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;strongly emphasizing the importance of something&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;i&gt;italicizing&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;em&gt;emphasizing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;u&gt;underlining&lt;/u&gt;, or &lt;s&gt;striking through&lt;/s&gt; text. &lt;/p&gt;
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>You may also wonder what's the difference between the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags, or <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags, if they essentially do the same thing? Well the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag is meant to be used for traditional italicized things, like an academic journal you're citing, whereas <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is meant for a kind of semantic emphasis. The same goes for <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>: use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for traditionally bolded things, like keywords or lead sentences, and use <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for semantically stressing the importance of something.</p>
						
						<p>It'd be impractical to go over all the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#elements-3" class="copy-link">HTML elements</a>. To this day, I sometimes will still look up details of an HTML tag because it's hard keeping track of all the different details of each programming language you learn. Don't feel bad about Googling.</p>

						<p>OK, so now you know the basic syntax of HTML and some HTML text fundamentals. What is each element like?</p>

						<p>Each HTML element is contained within a box. We already talked about nesting elements - this nesting can actually create what's known as a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_navigation.asp" class="copy-link">parent-child relationship</a>. For example, the bold, italics, etc. tags are children of the (parent) paragraph tag in the previous code block, and you can extrapolate that relationship to most of the structure provided by HTML. Within the boxes for each HTML element, you can create space within the box (padding, border) or outside the box (margin). <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp" class="copy-link">See the following model - the code for which I took from W3 schools</a>.</p>
						
						<div class="w3-boxmodel mainfont">
							<div class="margin">
							  <div class="border">
								<div class="padding">
								  <div class="content"></div>

						<p>Margin, border, and padding can be modified on all axes - left, right, top, and bottom. One example of this very box model concept is demonstrated in these code blocks. Which do you think was modified to get the background to be fully grey, and which do you think was modified for the left aligned blue line? Can you see how these will be useful for you when coding an experiment? Of note, previously I mentioned that while designing this site, I recognized I had put a lot of text on one page, so I tried to compensate by... increasing the top and bottom padding for the paragraph (p) elements!</p>
						
						<p>One other distinction that can be made about HTML elements refers to their default display. Are they considered block-level or inline elements? A typical inline element is contained within a block-level element, being a part of a line rather than causing a new line to appear (e.g., bolding text, creating hyperlinks). A block-level element is one that can create a new line and is often a structural element, like the paragraph text (p) element, headers, etc. You can still nest block-level elements, but they'd only be nested within more block-level elements (like all the p tags that are all nested here within the main text of this webpage!). Notably, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#element-content-categories" class="copy-link">recent updates to HTML</a> suggest this kind of distinction may not survive future iterations/edits, but it's useful for now.</p>
						
						<p>Remember how we established the basic syntax of HTML as opening tag + content + closing tag? Well, some HTML tags don't <em>need</em> a closing tag. These are special cases, called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Empty_element" class="copy-link">Empty/Void Elements</a>. They often involve defining certain information associated with the webpage or embedding information. For example, here are some (but not all of the possible) Empty Elements...</p>
						
						<p><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;col&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;base&gt;</code></p>
						
						<p>Some of these you've actually already seen used here, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr" class="copy-link">hr (Horizontal Rule) element</a>, which forms the thick grey line that I use to separate between Module sections. Images? You've already seen a number of images loaded on this site - and get this, HTML is so flexible that you can still include a closing tag. In my code, even though image is an Empty Element, there is still the <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag. Some of these other elements might be more obscure to you: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col" class="copy-link">col</a> is for creating a column within a table; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br" class="copy-link">br</a> is for creating a break/new line (would not suggest using this all the time! can use padding styling instead!). <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta" class="copy-link">Meta</a> refers to the metadata of a site, which includes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base" class="copy-link">Base</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" class="copy-link">Link</a>. Let's look at this with reference to our site:</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">

						<br>
						...<br>

						&lt;title&gt;Module 3 of Introductory Programming for Online Social Science Experiments&lt;/title&gt; <br>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!-- These are the HTML version of Comments: Favicons--&gt;</div>
						&lt;link href="files/favi_icon_website.png" rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" /&gt; <br>
						<br>
						...<br>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!--These comments do not impact the code: This is for those little thumbnails when the link is shared on twitter --&gt;</div>

						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!-- But it is good practice to comment your code: Bootstrap core CSS --&gt;</div>
						&lt;link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; <br>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!-- So that other people can understand what you're doing: Custom CSS --&gt;</div>
						&lt;link href="css/allpages.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;<br>
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>There's a lot to process in this last little blurb. At the simple end, you now know how to "comment" in HTML code, and you can see that I interchangeably am using "" and ''. However, I am never mixing ' and " in the same phrase, because that would not render any code/would cause an error. Sometimes you might see something like <code>&lt;input required&gt;</code>, and that essentially means a "blank" value for required= instead of writing out required="" or required=''.</p>
						
						<p>OK, but what is this metadata stuff? Well, you know how you can Google almost anything? The description meta tag above is what you would be shown as the description of this site, especially if you were Google searching the meta keywords that I defined. I'm essentially telling Search Engines this is what I think is important, this is how you should bookmark the site. Metadata is meant to help with Search Engine Optimization, much like how I even have meta tags here for what the twitter thumbnail and description should look like. Similarly, you know how each browser can have multiple tabs? Each tab has a title tag, like Accessibility Statement | The White House or Overview * Bootstrap. We define ours (which probably could be better, oops), and we also define the "favicon" (favorites icon, because it's used in the favorites/bookmarks lists) with the link tag; the favicon is the little picture logo/icon you can see representing the website in the browser tab. Some of this you might not need for an Experiment: you would for defining the CSS sheets (more below on CSS!) and probably the title tag in case your participants click out of your browser/tab and want to return, but some of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML" class="copy-link">other information</a>, maybe not.</p>
						
						<p>But, what's the deal with that target= thing in the element? Haven't we seen this before... like with the hyperlink also showing href= (hypertext reference equals...) and class= ....?</p>
												
						<p>Indeed you have! HTML elements also have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Attribute" class="copy-link">predefined attributes</a>. These can differentiate elements even without having any applied stylistic guidelines (like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id" class="copy-link">id="" global attribute</a>, which means you're giving that particular tag an identification). Often these attributes are used so you can apply particular rule or stylistic guidelines (via CSS and JavaScript).</p>
						
						<p>In the above example, regarding attributes, as part of the base tag, I have set "default" to be that I want hyperlinks to open in a new tab, unless otherwise specified. The target attribute defines where to display the linked URL: in the same page (_self) or current context; a new tab (_blank), etc. "href" (hypertext reference) as an attribute refers to the explicit URL you want to link to; for example, you can include an email with mailto:... as the href= or a full URL or the way that I've referred to files, like css/allpages.css. It's understood from basic file organization that that means a folder CSS that is higher than where this module3.html file is and the allpages.css file within that CSS folder (something you should probably know if you have basic programming knowledge). If you do use the a tag to create links, you should make sure your link text is actually descriptive. And the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class" class="copy-link">class global attribute</a> is one of the most frequently used attributes to indicate particular styling rules. I usually apply "copy-link" to all my links within these paragraph texts so that they'll be colored blue and underlined until you've visited or hovered over a link, at which point the link is colored purple, in line with the color branding of the site. Font size, text decorations, margins--so much can be altered with these classes! See the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3" class="copy-link">full list of attributes</a> here.</p>

						<p>OK, so we've gone over the syntax, the formatting, the display properties, and basic HTML elements and their attributes. What does the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure" class="copy-link">basic HTML structure</a> look like? Here's what this website looks like:</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>
						&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>
						&lt;head&gt;<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!--Within the head element tag, you typically load in CSS style sheets or other scripts... like: --&gt;</div>
						<br>
						...<br>
						<br>
						&lt;link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; <br>
						&lt;script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/25e7f7a6fa.js" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; <br>
						<br>
						...<br>
						<br>
						&lt;/head&gt;<br>
						&lt;body&gt;<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!--Within the body element tag, you typically put the content of the HTML document, first defined by a header across all the pages... --&gt;</div>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!--Usually for webpages, the navigation elements are shown next after you specify the body tag--&gt;</div>
						<br>
						&lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md fixed-top bg-blue"&gt;<br>
						&lt;button class="navbar-toggler navbar-toggler-right" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNavDropdown" aria-controls="navbarNavDropdown" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;<br>
						&lt;span class="fas fa-bars"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; <br>
						&lt;/button&gt; <br>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!--One thing to note is that whitespace within an HTML element does not matter. As long as you're using the carrot/angular brackets, you're good        --&gt;</div>
						&lt;div class="row" id="body-row"             &gt; <br>
						&lt;div id="sidebar-container" class="d-none d-md-block col-2 bg-grey"&gt; <br>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!--After the navigation bar, I define the sidebar on this site... and after that, we get to the main content... --&gt;</div>
						<br>
						&lt;div class="col py-3" id="page-content"&gt;<br>
						&lt;main&gt; <br>
						&lt;section&gt;<br>
						&lt;h1&gt;Module 3: Customized Design with JavaScript, HTML, &amp; CSS&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
						...<br>
						&lt;div&gt;<br>
						&lt;p&gt;Why learn JavaScript...&lt;/p&gt;<br>
						&lt;/div&gt;<br>
						&lt;/section&gt;<br>
						&lt;/main&gt;<br>
						&lt;/body&gt;<br>
						&lt;/html&gt;<br>
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>As you can see from the code above, the file starts out with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html" class="copy-link">HTML tag</a>, within which all other tags are nested. We then go to a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head" class="copy-link">head</a> tag, define styling rules and load in other JavaScript (more below!) and then get into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" class="copy-link">body</a> meat of the document. You can see even in this brief example the consistent use of id and class attributes. You can even see how each of these modules is structured, with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" class="copy-link">"nav" element</a> showing how to navigate the site, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main" class="copy-link">"main" element tag</a> that then goes to each <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" class="copy-link">section</a>, which has its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements" class="copy-link">own header</a> (just like in a newspaper!), and then has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" class="copy-link">div element</a> to group together all the paragraph text elements that are under that particular header... Oh, wow, that's a lot, huh? So let's look at the basics of one of these subsections in more detail, too:</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;ul class="fa-ul"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;span class="fa-li"&gt; &lt;i class="fas fa-star"&gt; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;h4 id="subsec31t1"&gt; Providing structure and content with HTML &lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>This is the code that creates the subsection/tutorial header "Providing structure and content with HTML". <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" class="copy-link">UL</a> stands for "unordered list" and is a type of HTML element used to create bullet-point lists. The class "fa-ul" is special, referring to the CSS package I load in from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery" class="copy-link">Font Awesome</a>, which has an entire library of free icons that people can use on their webpages. We've already talked about the class attribute, and this class is "fa-ul", indicating it's the Font Awesome Unordered List (class). <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li" class="copy-link">LI</a> stands for "list item" and is often a bullet point within the "UL". Notably, you can also have "ordered lists" or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol" class="copy-link">OL</a> (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu" class="copy-link">menus</a>, which are also composed of LI elements. Next up in the header code is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" class="copy-link">"span"</a>, which doesn't necessarily stand for anything, but is often used to group together elements for styling in a particular line. (In this case, we're saying that the span element is of the "fa-li" class, or Font Awesome List Item (class); one thing to note here is that it's important to be able to read and mark other code, and the Font Awesome folks have made that possible: anything that is fa- or fas/fab is likely a Font Awesome styled element). So, after specifying the styling for the list element via the span element and its class, we use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i" class="copy-link">"i" element</a>, or idiomatic text element, which here is of the Font Awesome Solid and Font Awesome Star (classes), i.e., the star icon that you see next to the header. Essentially, I wanted to use a marker besides the indent that I have set (in CSS) for the header classes and thus created star bullet points to indicate each new subsection. After styling, we see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements" class="copy-link">"h4" element</a>, which stands for the 4th header element. There are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 header elements, and they differ in designation, with 1 being the highest section level and 6 the lowest (often shown in differing sizes). On this site, I use the h1 element for the Module Title, the h2 element for each Section Title (e.g., <a href="#subsec31" class="copy-link">Basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</a>), and the h4 element for any subsection/tutorial. It is particularly important to follow a sort of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals" class="copy-link">hierarchical designation</a> as a means of ensuring accessibility: screen readers rely on sites being designated in a hierarchical fashion, with headers indicated by these h elements, sections indicated by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" class="copy-link">section elements</a>, navigation links indicated by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" class="copy-link">nav elements</a>, and paragraph elements like this text being indicated by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" class="copy-link">p elements</a>, which we discussed above. If you don't use this kind of structure, the HTML can appear as a kind of text chunk that is really hard to read. We put the header as part of the LI element and UL list to make sure that they're aligned at the same level (otherwise the code will not group together the elements). I also gave the header the id of subsec31t1, representing module 3, section 1, tutorial 1 and that it is a subsection. Each section or subsection has its own id so that if I wanted to link you there, I could easily do that, since ids should be unique to elements you'll navigate to.</p>
						
						<p>And voila! That is one line of code within this particular site, and we've gone over the general site structure too. In your experiments, you may not really need to use bullet points (LI, UL, OL) - that probably depends on how you like to give instructions - but you should abide by standard guidelines for header and page elements, at the very least. Part of the reason you have this kind of organization is to be consistent in how you direct people's attention. It's like how when we read a newspaper, we see their headlines, and then the titles of the different articles, and where our eyes go will depend on how everything is laid out, right? And then there's also the accesibility part of this, too: some folks use screan readers to listen to how a webpage is rendered, and these screen readers rely on consistent structure like this to work well.</p>
						
						<p>The last thing to know... How do you know when something has gone wrong? How can you debug HTML? There are two types of errors: syntax errors, where you have spelling errors in the code, or logic errors, where the code is not running how you've intended for whatever reason. A syntax error usually produces an error message of some kind, but HTML has what's known as "permissive" code so it'll still run, despite the spelling error. It will be very evident though that something has gone wrong. A logic error, you'll have to work through. For example, remember when I mentioned forgetting to close an "a" tag and having an entire paragraph underlined and in blue/purple, as though a link? If you've got your text editor program open, try typing some HTML. Try putting in an attribute, but don't close the tag. Do you see what happens to the code? Your text editor program - even if it's as basic as mine is, Notepad++ - will show different colors to indicate oh no! error! please fix the opening tag! I can't show you explicit errors on this webpage without messing up my formatting, so <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/debugging-html/debug-example.html" class="copy-link">try this example out</a> in your Text Editor.</p>
						
						<p>Here are some error "types" you might run into:</p>

						<ul>
						  <li>Unclosed elements: Make sure to CLOSE your tags, until you want the effects to spread to other elements...
						  <li>Badly nested elements: Remember our discussion of the subsection header with LI elements? What if you flipped around the elements?</em>
						  <li>Unclosed attributes: Remember what I said about links? What if I linked <a href="https://socsciprogramming.github.io/" class="copy-link">to our site</a> but forgot the second "?
						</ul>
						
						<p>Here are some examples of these errors (inspired by the debugging-example linked above) in the code section below!</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;h6&gt; An error-related demo!&lt;/h6&gt;<br>
						<br>
						&lt;p&gt; There are so many ways to have errors in HTML...<br>
						<br>
						&lt;ul&gt;<br>
						&lt;li&gt; Unclosed elements: Make sure to CLOSE your &lt;strong&gt;tags, until you want the effects to spread to other elements...<br>
						&lt;li&gt; Badly nested elements: Remember our discussion of &lt;strong&gt;strong &lt;em&gt;strong emphasised?&lt;/strong&gt; and the subsection header with LI elements? What if you flipped around the titles?&lt;/em&gt;<br>
						&lt;li&gt; Unclosed attributes: Remember what I said about links? What if I linked &lt;a href="https://socsciprogramming.github.io/&gt;to our site&lt;/a&gt; but forgot the second "? What do you see happening here?<br>
						&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>When you're ready to publish your site, you can also run your HTML through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" class="copy-link">Markup Validation Service</a>. It will output some error issues for you if they exist.</p>
						
						<p>You've learned quite a lot about HTML! From the syntax to various elements to display properties, boxes, attributes, and file structure and more, we've gone at a pretty rapid pace--and would you believe me if I said that's not even the tip of the iceberg? But it should be enough for you to understand the basics and how we will manipulate these for our applied social science experiments.</p>

						<p>The first thing you might wonder is... do you need CSS? Maybe you've seen something like this before:</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;div style="color:#1D6363"&gt; &lt;!--One thing to note is that whitespace within an HTML element does not matter. As long as you're using the carrot/angular brackets, you're good        --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>You might recognize this as one of the comments I wrote above in the HTML section on code for the website. I used styling within an HTML tag to color the comments green within the code block. You could do this kind of inline styling to any HTML element you want. So, what will CSS help in that case? Well, can you imagine how annoying it would be to put styling on every single HTML element you have? Already even on this one module page, we've got numerous lines of code, numerous paragraph elements for each tutorial, and I cannot tell you how bad it would be to have to repeat the styling every single time and to keep track of how I've styled every single in line element. That's one of the big benefits of CSS: a rule-based language invented to govern styling that's applied to elements or groups of elements, whether that's through a global attribute like a class, a particular ID you've given an element, or a specific tag like in the example above.</p>
						
						<p>CSS follows a set of rules made of selectors and declarations (just as an HTML element is made of opening tag + content + closing tag). A selector is either the ID, class, or tag (i.e., the HTML element) that is going to be styled. After selecting that element, you declare what you're going to do: what property you want to target (color, font-size, font-family) and what value you want that property to take. Every statement has to end with a semi-colon. Let's look at a few simple examples from the styling of this website.</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">
						h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, .headerfont {font-family: "Playfair Display";}<br>
						p, .mainfont, code, pre {font-family: "Open Sans";  color: #262626;}<br>
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>In these first two lines of the custom CSS for the site, I select all the header elements (h1-h6) and a new class that I am defining (.headerfont) to have a serif font, "Playfair Display". The header elements are the selector; font-family is the property; Playfair Display is the value of that property; and together font-family and playfair display are the declaration that is enclosed in curly brackets and ends with a semi-colon. On the next line, I select the p/paragraph text element, a new class I'm defining (.mainfont), and the code and pre elements, and declare that I want these to show in a sans serif font, Open Sans, and that I want the color to be a kind of charcoal that is in the <a href="https://brand.duke.edu/colors/" class="copy-link">Duke colors brand guide</a>. The fonts are consistent with the <a href="https://brand.duke.edu/typography/" class="copy-link">Duke typography brand guide</a>. You may have noticed even in this example that you can select multiple "selectors" in your declaration statement all at once, with a comma between the different selectors.</p>
						
						<p>You may have noticed just from this example that each property is going to have its own unique value. I could not put "Open Sans" as the value for color; color takes color values, like predefined names (blue, red, white, etc.) or hex codes (#262626) or RGB (red green blue) values, etc. Font-family takes the name of a particular font that you have to have loaded in your browser. And so on. In the second example, you may note that we even make 2 declarations with 2 different values for 2 different properties within the same set of curly brackets. You can make as many as you want, but sometimes it's not advantageous to have too many. If I wanted to apply this different elements, the more properties I have declared, the less flexible that class/element will be, given my styling rules. It is also hard to remember all the different CSS properties; MDN has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" class="copy-link">CSS reference guide</a>, and I personally Google wheneveer I can't remember a particular property.</p>
						
						<p>OK, so how do you actually add CSS to an HTML document? Do you remember our trusty HTML element "link" from the previous tutorial? Well, here it is again, within this module:</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>
						&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>
						&lt;head&gt;<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!--Within the head element tag, you typically load in CSS style sheets or other scripts... like: --&gt;</div>
						<br>
						...<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!-- Bootstrap core CSS + font awesome JS for icons--&gt;</div>
						&lt;link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; <br>
						&lt;script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/25e7f7a6fa.js" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; <br>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!-- Custom CSS --&gt;</div>
						&lt;link href="css/allpages.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;<br>
						<br>
						<div style="color:#1D6363">&lt;!-- Loading fonts; pairing serif fonts in headers w/ sans serif for body--&gt;</div>
						&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,600;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,600;1,700&family=Playfair+Display+SC:wght@400;700&family=Playfair+Display:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&gt;<br>
						<br>
						...<br>
						<br>
						&lt;/head&gt;<br>
						&lt;body&gt;<br>
						... <br>
						&lt;/body&gt;<br>
						&lt;/html&gt;<br>
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>CSS is typically specified within the head element of an HTML document. I link to a preestablished set of CSS (Bootstrap, which we will discuss again in <a href="module4.html" class="copy-link" target="_self">Module 4</a>), as well as the custom sheet of rules I've made for this website, plus the fonts that I want to grab from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" class="copy-link">Google's Fonts API</a>. I was able to do so with the link tag and its rel attribute marking that this is a stylesheet.</p>
						
						<p>One thing you may have also noticed about this site is that when you load it for the first time, it takes a few seconds for the CSS to be applied. You may wonder, how did Firefox and Chrome render the same content in slightly different ways? Well, each browser also has its own set of default styles, and if I'm changing part of that - like a particular font - it will take a little for the browser to load in that information and change that style. <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1397485/the-chrome-browser-default-setting-of-fonts" class="copy-link">The default font on Chrome</a> is "Font size: 16; Standard font, Serif font: Times New Roman; Sans-serif font: Arial; Fixed-width font: Consolas." And here on this site, I change those default fonts. If you ever are curious about all the CSS properties and their defaults, you can take a look at the MDN guide.</p>
						
						<p>Earlier, I mentioned the CSS classes of "headerfont" and "mainfont." You can tell in the CSS that I'm referring to a class, because it's preceded by a period ("full stop character"). Each selector will have its own way of being selected - standard HTML elements like the paragraph text, p tag, can be selected without specifying the full stop character. We'll go over different selectors little by little. So, let's take a look at a class that has been applyied to a lot of places. Here's the CSS code.</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">
						.copy-link, .copy-link:link {color: #012169;}<br>
						a.copy-link{text-decoration: underline;}<br>
						.copy-link:hover, .copy-link:active, .copy-link:focus, .copy-link:visited {color: #993399;}<br>
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>This means that whenever I call upon the class copy-link, it will be shown in blue, and look, a combination of the HTML element tag & a class (a.copy-link)! That means that all a tags with the copy-link class will have the underline value assigned to the text-decoration property. And after that, I specify more: that is, I style based on "state" (:hover, :active, :focus, :visited). When you hover over a link or have already visited it or focus on it via the keyboard or the link is in the process of being activated/clicked, the link will turn purple. And here's one small version of the HTML code.</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
						&lt;p&gt;CSS is typically specified within the head element of an HTML document. I link to a preestablished set of CSS (Bootstrap, which we will discuss again in &lt;a href="module4.html" class="copy-link" target="_self"&gt;Module 4&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the custom sheet of rules I've made for this website, plus the fonts that I want to grab from &lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/" class="copy-link"&gt;Google's Fonts API&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to do so with the link tag and its rel attribute marking that this is a stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>As you can see in the HTML, applying a class is fairly easy - just like adding in the attributes we talked about and making sure you've enclosed the class statement within quotations. Another type of styling you can do is based on location in the HTML document. Here's another example from this website:</p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">
						section div {padding-top: 0.7rem; padding-bottom: 0.7rem;}
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>Here I'm saying all "div" HTML elements that are placed within a "section" HTML element should have a specific top and bottom padding (remember padding from our previous tutorial?). In this case, we're using a "descendent combinator" and specifically selecting a nested element. If you remember from the last tutorial, this site is styled so that each tutorial is its own section, and each tutorial section is subsumed within a subsection, and there are specific numbers of subsections that make up a module. And, within each section, I group together the p elements with a div element. That's why you get different spaces between the p elements and the headers between each section. Along the lines of combining selectors in a declaration, you can indicate the location with a +. Like instead of targeting the div elements within a section, knowing that I'd be about to start a new section anyway with a header, I could've written a similar rule like h2 + p, h4 + p {padding...}. This would mean that any p element that came straight after a h2 or h4 element (i.e., the headers) had special values for their padding. The plus sign in this selector is known as an adjacent sibling combinator.</p>
						
						<p>Pretty much any of the combinations I've already talked about, you can do all at once if you really want to get specific about certain parts of your code. </p>
						
						<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">
						<div style="color:#1D6363">/* Submenu item - make the subsections look smaller + have them indented more left*/</div>
						#sidebar-container .list-group .sidebar-submenu a {padding-left: 30px;}<br>
						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p>This targets the HTML element with the id sidebar-container (ids selected with #) possessing the classes list-group and sidebar-submenu and the a tag within those. It then says, give 30 pixels of padding on the left side. Have you noticed how the items in the module sidebar are indented? And another thing to note is that making comments in CSS also differs slightly from HTML (/* ... */ instead of the carrot/angles beside the exclamation mark and dashes to mark opening and closing tags. </p>
						
						<p>OK, so I actually only showed you one way of linking to a stylesheet. That way was the 'external' stylesheet reference. You can actually refer to the styling of an HTML document within internal tags as well. We also do it on this site for...</p>

						</code></pre></div>
						
						<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp" class="copy-link">The W3Schools box model</a>! You can create an internal stylesheet by linking to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style" class="copy-link">HTML tags for style</a> within your document. And note that padding, border, and margin are all properties that you can make a declaration for within CSS. Also, of note, regardless of whether you're using an internal or external stylesheet, spaces don't really matter that much within CSS. That is, you'll see in a lot of premade CSS stylesheets selectors and declarations like the following: .w3-boxmodel {margin: 30px 0;} .w3-boxmodel .margin {padding: 25px;}. The fact that there's not a separate line between the two will not affect the running of the style rules involved here.</p>
						
						<p>OK, so how can you tell your CSS isn't working out? The most likely scenario is that your selectors are not matching the way you think. I often forget the specific way that I have to refer to a class versus a state (versus some other selectors we will discuss) and will Google this and play around until I get a site to look the way I want.</p>
						
						<p>One way that you might run into an error is simply because of how CSS is organized. That is, why it's called a Cascading Style Sheet.</p>
						
						<p>The cascading model means that 1) the latest rule takes precedence over the previous rule. If you declare a value for a property twice in the stylesheet, the one that will be applied is the later rule. If you're applying multiple classes to an HTML element that have conflicting property values in their declarations, what do you think will happen? And 2) there's also specificity in the cascading model, where the most unique selectors take precedence over the less unique selectors. As you might guess, that means an ID (which should be specific to certain elements) takes precedence over a Class which takes precedence over Tags (i.e., inline styling).</p>

						<p>Most values for properties are keywords or numeric values. Sometimes, they are not. One example comes from the pie chart on the home page of this site.</p>
						
						<p> ... </p>
						
						<p>OK, so how does this all actually apply to when you're coding a study? In most experiments, I don't use as much CSS as I do with styling webpages like this or my own personal website. I try to use CSS as a framework that guides User Experience, like making buttons a certain color and shape to be consistent across the entire experiment. I specify Arial as the font for basically everything, since it's a pretty standard (i.e., on most computers) and easy to read font. Even using a small amount of CSS, though, can help you abide by our guiding online programming and design principles, as discussed in <a href="module2.html" class="copy-link" target="_self">Module 2</a>. But of course this all depends on your particular goals: in my webpage studies, I don't want people to take the study on a mobile device, so I specifically ensure they can't (window must be greater than 800 x 600, plus the experiment asks for keypresses). This of course limits the generalizability of my study and desire to participate, I'm sure, but also means I don't need to make as many styling changes. All that being said, let's look at my colleague, Nick's, demostration experiments that are coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</p>

			making the user experience a little better with javascript tweaks. for example, you can customize the words on the 'next' button on individual pages to say stuff like "proceed to experiment" or "view consent" to cue people. or if you have a text box, you can put dummy text in it that disappears when you click on it that provides an example of the type of response you're thinking of - I would describe this as thinking with an `ux copy` mind for experiments

						<p>If you want to "explore" on your own, let me suggest opening the JavaScript Developer Console on this site. Then edit whatever HTML you'd like and see what happens - live - to the site itself. What does each CSS styling correspond to? What does each element correspond to? What happens if you add more JavaScript to the site? One of the best ways to learn how to code is to take something that already exists and mess with it until you see what your changes do. Then you'll have a framework to work with when you are coding on your own.</p>
						
						<p>Find one of your favorite websites and open the Developer console. For example, why not take a look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" class="copy-link">Mozilla Developer site for HTML</a>? It's beautifully styled, with a clear hierarchy of information and tables to define particular elements. You can learn more about all the possible HTML elements while looking at how they've coded the structure of the site and how their CSS has styled the site with an almost magazine-like modern, clean look. Poke around and see how they've defined everything.</p>
						
						<p>Create a sample pre-screen HIT on MTurk, applying what you learned from Module 1, that is coded in the HTML/source interface with CSS styling, applying what you learned from Module 3, and that uses basic survey design principles, applying what you learned from Module 2, to assess participant demographics.</p>
